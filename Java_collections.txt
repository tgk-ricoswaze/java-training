---------------------------------
List collections - collections with an iteration order -> every element has an index association. 

	- Use list collections to add elements to an ArrayList or LinkedList
	-LinkedLikst main use for adding large amounts to the start of the list. 

Map collections - sets an ID to a value to create a dictionary.

	- HashMap and TreeMap implementations
	- HashMap is more commonly used

	Hashchode should be immutable, and return the same value consistently for each key. 

---------------------------------------
Java Streams - allows you to write code that reads more like the business problem being solved. 

	- Use a collector to grab the elements of the stream and group them.
----------------------------------------
Factory methods - builds new instances of collections that can be made unmodifiable, immutable, empty and wrapping collections

Operations - Useful collection algorithms  

-----------------------------------------
Sets - Allows you to add a collection of unique values into a HashSet or TreeSet
