Creating a JAR file

JAR - Java Archived file

Create a MANIFEST.MF file containing metadata:
	
	file -> project structure -> artifacts -> Add Jar file -> select main class -> include in project build -> run the code to create an artifact directory

You can run the jar file outside the dev environment:

Use cmd and go to the artifact directory.
run [java -jar (name of file.jar)]

Build tools usually create jar files along with their dependancies and packages them -> pushes them to a repository. 
---> Maven and Gradle are main build tools for real java dev work.
