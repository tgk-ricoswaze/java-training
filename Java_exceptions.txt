Exceptions are non-intrusive ways to signal and handle errors

Try/catch blocks - Runs catch block when an exception occurs in the try block of code. 

Finally block allows for manual cleanup
	-always runs following a try or catch
Automating cleanup with Try-with-resources statement
	- can be used with any type that implements AutoCloseable interface. 

Try can have multiple catch blocks that run from top to bottom. 
	-most specific exceptions should be first

Checked exceptions are those that will be caught by the compiler in an IDE.

Unchecked exceptions are only caught during runtime. 

You can create a new exception using the new operator and include information with constructor 
	- example: [throw new IllegalArgumentException("...")]

Exceptions can be chained and accessed with getCause method
